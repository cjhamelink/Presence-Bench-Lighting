Presence-Bench-Lighting
=======================

Physical Interaction Project at KTH for DH2400. The purpose of this project is to make a public installation of a bench that is lit from below with RGB LEDs based on where, and how long people sit on the bench.

A checklist of some things we need to do to make this project a reality.
<ul>
	<li>Check with SL or Library to see if we can make this public instalation in a couple weeks</li>
	<li>Order RGB LEDs, drives, temperature sensors, wiring, enclosures, etc</li>
	<li>Refine RGB control code, temperature readings, calibration, and other tweaks</li>
	<li>Learn how to multiplex analog inputs from sensors, and ouputs to LEDs or get Ardunio Mega?</li>
	<li>Figure out how to document people using the bench (cameras, legality, etc)</li>
</ul>
